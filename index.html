            <div class="border-left">
              <p>I'm a coding bootcamp student with a dream to become a software engineer one day. Ever since I was young and on computers, I always used dev tools, and was curious about what is what, and what makes up a website. 
                I'm a strong believer of "You can do anything you set your mind to". No matter how hard something might get or be, I don't give up. When I was a teenager, I didn't make the best decision; 
                I dropped out of highschool, but I didn't let that stop me. In 2021 I decided that I wanted to be somebody one day, somebody that I would be proud of. Shortly after that, I decided to earn my GED and get my drivers license.
                I keep pushing forward to pursue my dreams, and I will never give up. I enjoy challenge, problem solving, computer science, and I am accepting of criticism; 
                that's why I believe I'll be a good software engineer one day.
